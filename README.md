## Project's Goal
The main goal of this project is building an android application to support blind people’s lives. As we know, when a blind
person search for something, it turns a torture for her/him. Our application tries to make their life more comfortable and
easier. It is a cloud based application for detect object. All her/his has to do is take the phone out of pocket, open the
application and hold the phone up. The application identifies the object and the object will be audible also. The user can
instruct like “Where is my red cup?” after that the application searches for red cup. When detect the cup, smart device tells
to user.
